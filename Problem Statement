With the increasing volume of credit card transactions, financial institutions and consumers face
challenges in understanding spending patterns, segmenting customer behaviors, and identifying
fraudulent activities. Despite the abundance of transactional data, meaningful insights are often
obscured by the data's sheer volume and complexity. This project aims to bridge this gap by
developing a comprehensive data visualization and analysis framework that enables the
extraction of actionable insights. Through spending pattern analysis, customer segmentation,
and anomaly detection, the project will provide an intuitive and secure approach for stakeholders
to make informed decisions, enhance financial planning, and improve fraud detection in credit
card transactions.
