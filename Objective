The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize credit card transaction data to
reveal meaningful patterns in consumer spending, categorize customers based on transaction
behavior, and enhance fraud detection. By processing and cleaning the data, we ensure accurate
insights, enabling us to uncover trends across various categories, demographics, and time
frames. The project also aims to use clustering for customer segmentation, allowing for
personalized recommendations and targeted marketing. Additionally, anomaly detection will be
implemented to identify potential fraudulent transactions, ultimately contributing to financial
security and enhancing decision-making for both consumers and businesses.
