The dataset for this project is composed of transactional and demographic data fields relevant to
analyzing consumer spending behavior and identifying anomalies. Key components include:
1. Transaction Data:
o Transaction ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
o Timestamp: Date and time of the transaction.
o Amount: Monetary value of each transaction.
o Merchant Details: Merchant name, category (e.g., groceries, utilities, travel), and
location.
o Transaction Type: Type of transaction, such as online, in-person, recurring, etc.
o
2. Customer Demographics:
o Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
o Age: Age of the customer.
o Gender: Gender of the customer.
o Income Level: Annual or monthly income bracket.
o Location: Geographical location of the customer, such as city or region.

UNDERSTANDING THE DATA :
Review Key Attributes: Examine attributes such as Transaction ID, Amount, Merchant
Details, Timestamp, and Customer Demographics (age, gender, income).
Identify Data Types: Recognize whether variables are numerical (e.g., Transaction Amount),
categorical (e.g., Merchant Category), or time-based (e.g., Timestamp), as each type requires
different preprocessing.
Summary Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for
numerical attributes and frequency distributions for categorical variables.
Data Visualization: Use histograms, scatter plots, and time-series plots to uncover trends,
seasonal patterns, and anomalies in spending behavior.
Segmentation: Segment the data based on customer demographics (e.g., age, income) to
identify spending patterns across different groups.
Feature Relationships: Identify correlations and relationships between features (e.g., spending
amount vs. merchant type) to guide further analysis or model development.
Understanding these aspects helps in selecting and transforming the right features for more
accurate analysis and predictions. 

DATA COLLECTION AND IMPORT:
Data Collection:
The data for credit card transaction analysis can be collected from various sources such as
financial institutions, credit card providers, or publicly available datasets related to transactional
data. For real-world applications, data might be gathered via secure APIs provided by payment
gateways or banks, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR.
The dataset may include transaction records, customer demographic information, merchant
details, and potentially even additional data such as geographical or behavioral information.
Data Import:
Once collected, the data can be imported into a suitable environment for analysis, typically
using programming languages like Python or R.
Python: Libraries like pandas and numpy are commonly used to import and manage data. For
example, data can be loaded from CSV, Excel, or SQL databases using commands
 DATA CLEANING:
 To ensure accurate and unbiased analysis, data cleaning was performed as follows:
 Handling Missing Values: Impute missing data with the mean or mode for numerical and
categorical variables, or remove rows with excessive missing values.
 Removing Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries to maintain data accuracy.
 Correcting Errors: Fix issues like out-of-range values or inconsistent formatting, ensuring
all entries are valid.
 Data Type Conversion: Ensure columns are in the correct data types (e.g., converting
transaction amounts to numerical values).
 Dealing with Outliers: Identify and handle outliers in numerical data using methods like Zscores or IQR to prevent skewed results
