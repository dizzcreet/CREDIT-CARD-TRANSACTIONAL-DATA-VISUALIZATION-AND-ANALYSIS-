1. Customer Demographics:
o Age Groups: Segment customers into age groups (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, etc.) to
identify different spending behaviors across age ranges.
o Income Levels: Group customers based on income brackets (e.g., low, middle,
high) to observe how income influences spending patterns.
o Gender or Location: Segment by gender or geographical region to explore
potential differences in transaction habits and preferences.
2. Transaction Behavior:
o Transaction Amount: Group customers based on average transaction amounts
(e.g., small, medium, large spenders) to analyze high-value customers and
identify potential fraud or loyalty patterns.
o Merchant Categories: Segment by spending in various categories like groceries,
travel, entertainment, or utilities to understand customer preferences and
spending tendencies.
3. Temporal Segmentation:
o Time of Day/Week: Analyze transaction frequency by time of day, day of the
week, or month to detect seasonal or time-based patterns in spending.
o Recurring vs. One-Time Purchases: Separate recurring subscription
transactions from one-time purchases to assess customer loyalty and lifetime
value.
4. Behavioral Segmentation:
o Frequent vs. Infrequent Shoppers: Group customers who make regular
transactions versus those who shop sporadically to identify loyal customers
versus potential churn risks.
o Fraudulent vs. Legitimate Transactions: Segment fraudulent transactions from
legitimate ones for more focused fraud detection and analysis.
