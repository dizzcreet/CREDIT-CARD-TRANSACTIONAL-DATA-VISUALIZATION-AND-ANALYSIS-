# CREDIT-CARD-TRANSACTIONAL-DATA-VISUALIZATION-AND-ANALYSIS-
This project focuses on the visualization and analysis of credit card transactional
data to uncover spending patterns, detect anomalies, and derive actionable
insights. By leveraging data science techniques, we will process and visualize
transaction data to identify trends such as seasonal spending habits, merchant
preferences, and demographic influences on spending behavior. Additionally,
the project will explore clustering techniques for customer segmentation and
apply anomaly detection methods to flag potential fraudulent transactions.
Through interactive dashboards and visualizations, stakeholders can engage
with the data intuitively, aiding in decision-making processes for both financial
management and risk mitigation. This comprehensive analysis aims to provide
valuable insights for businesses and consumers alike, enhancing understanding
of credit card usage trends and financial behavior..
